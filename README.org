#+TITLE: Write yourself a Git!

Source repository for the [[https://wyag.thb.lt][Write yourself a Git]] article.

Wyag is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate program]] written in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], which means the same source document can be used to produce the HTML version of the article as published on [[https://wyag.thb.lt]] and the program itself.  You only need a reasonably recent Emacs and the =make= program, then:

#+begin_src shell
  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/thblt/write-yourself-a-git
  $ cd write-yourself-a-git
  $ make all
#+end_src
